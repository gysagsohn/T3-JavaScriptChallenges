# T3-JavaScriptChallenges

Welcome to my repository for weekly coding challenge solutions. These challenges are part of my bootcamp, and I've finally found the time to work on them since transitioning to part-time work.

For each challenge, I will include a description of the problem in the README file and provide a separate file with my solution.


# JavaScript Challenge 1. Rotate String

796. Rotate String

Given two strings s and goal, return true if and only if s can become goal after some number of shifts on s.

A shift on s consists of moving the leftmost character of s to the rightmost position.

For example, if s = "abcde", then it will be "bcdea" after one shift.
 

Example 1:

Input: s = "abcde", goal = "cdeab"
Output: true
Example 2:

Input: s = "abcde", goal = "abced"
Output: false
 

Constraints:

1 <= s.length, goal.length <= 100
s and goal consist of lowercase English letters.
