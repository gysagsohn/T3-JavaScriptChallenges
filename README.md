# T3-JavaScriptChallenges

Welcome to my repository for weekly coding challenge solutions. These challenges are part of my bootcamp, and I've finally found the time to work on them since transitioning to part-time work.

For each challenge, I will include a description of the problem in the README file and provide a separate file with my solution.


# JavaScript Challenge 1. Rotate String

796. Rotate String

Given two strings s and goal, return true if and only if s can become goal after some number of shifts on s.

A shift on s consists of moving the leftmost character of s to the rightmost position.

For example, if s = "abcde", then it will be "bcdea" after one shift.
 

Example 1:

Input: s = "abcde", goal = "cdeab"
Output: true
Example 2:

Input: s = "abcde", goal = "abced"
Output: false
 

Constraints:

1 <= s.length, goal.length <= 100
s and goal consist of lowercase English letters.

# JavaScript Challenge 2. Length of Last Word

Given a string s consisting of words and spaces, return the length of the last word in the string.

A word is a maximal substring consisting of non-space characters only.

 
Example 1:
Input: s = "Hello World"
Output: 5
Explanation: The last word is "World" with length 5.

Example 2:
Input: s = "   fly me   to   the moon  "
Output: 4
Explanation: The last word is "moon" with length 4.

Example 3:
Input: s = "luffy is still joyboy"
Output: 6
Explanation: The last word is "joyboy" with length 6.
 

Constraints:
1 <= s.length <= 10^4
s consists of only English letters and spaces ' '.
There will be at least one word in s.

/**
 * @param {string} s
 * @return {number}
 */
var lengthOfLastWord = function(s) {
    
};

# JavaScript Challenge 3. Matrix Diagonal Sum

https://leetcode.com/problems/matrix-diagonal-sum/

Given a square matrix mat, return the sum of the matrix diagonals.

Only include the sum of all the elements on the primary diagonal and all the elements on the secondary diagonal that are not part of the primary diagonal.

Input: mat = [[1,2,3],
              [4,5,6],
              [7,8,9]]
Output: 25
Explanation: Diagonals sum: 1 + 5 + 9 + 3 + 7 = 25
Notice that element mat[1][1] = 5 is counted only once.

Example 2:

Input: mat = [[1,1,1,1],
              [1,1,1,1],
              [1,1,1,1],
              [1,1,1,1]]
Output: 8

Example 3:

Input: mat = [[5]]
Output: 5

Constraints:

n == mat.length == mat[i].length
1 <= n <= 100
1 <= mat[i][j] <= 100

/**
 * @param {number[][]} mat
 * @return {number}
 */
var diagonalSum = function(mat) {
    
};
