# T3-JavaScriptChallenges

Welcome to my repository for weekly coding challenge solutions. These challenges are part of my bootcamp, and I've finally found the time to work on them since transitioning to part-time work.

For each challenge, I will include a description of the problem in the README file and provide a separate file with my solution.


# JavaScript Challenge 1. Rotate String

796. Rotate String

Given two strings s and goal, return true if and only if s can become goal after some number of shifts on s.

A shift on s consists of moving the leftmost character of s to the rightmost position.

For example, if s = "abcde", then it will be "bcdea" after one shift.
 

Example 1:

Input: s = "abcde", goal = "cdeab"
Output: true
Example 2:

Input: s = "abcde", goal = "abced"
Output: false
 

Constraints:

1 <= s.length, goal.length <= 100
s and goal consist of lowercase English letters.

# JavaScript Challenge 2. Length of Last Word

Given a string s consisting of words and spaces, return the length of the last word in the string.

A word is a maximal substring consisting of non-space characters only.

 
Example 1:
Input: s = "Hello World"
Output: 5
Explanation: The last word is "World" with length 5.

Example 2:
Input: s = "   fly me   to   the moon  "
Output: 4
Explanation: The last word is "moon" with length 4.

Example 3:
Input: s = "luffy is still joyboy"
Output: 6
Explanation: The last word is "joyboy" with length 6.
 

Constraints:
1 <= s.length <= 10^4
s consists of only English letters and spaces ' '.
There will be at least one word in s.

/**
 * @param {string} s
 * @return {number}
 */
var lengthOfLastWord = function(s) {
    
};

# JavaScript Challenge 3. Matrix Diagonal Sum

https://leetcode.com/problems/matrix-diagonal-sum/

Given a square matrix mat, return the sum of the matrix diagonals.

Only include the sum of all the elements on the primary diagonal and all the elements on the secondary diagonal that are not part of the primary diagonal.

![alt text](image.png)

Input: mat = [[1,2,3],
              [4,5,6],
              [7,8,9]]
Output: 25
Explanation: Diagonals sum: 1 + 5 + 9 + 3 + 7 = 25
Notice that element mat[1][1] = 5 is counted only once.

Example 2:

Input: mat = [[1,1,1,1],
              [1,1,1,1],
              [1,1,1,1],
              [1,1,1,1]]
Output: 8

Example 3:

Input: mat = [[5]]
Output: 5

Constraints:

n == mat.length == mat[i].length
1 <= n <= 100
1 <= mat[i][j] <= 100

```
/**
 * @param {number[][]} mat
 * @return {number}
 */
var diagonalSum = function(mat) {
    
};
```

# JavaScript Challenge 4. Two Sum

https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/description/

Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].
Example 2:

Input: nums = [3,2,4], target = 6
Output: [1,2]
Example 3:

Input: nums = [3,3], target = 6
Output: [0,1]
 

Constraints:

2 <= nums.length <= 104
-109 <= nums[i] <= 109
-109 <= target <= 109
Only one valid answer exists.
 

Follow-up: Can you come up with an algorithm that is less than O(n2) time complexity?

```JS 
/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @param {number} target
 * @return {number[]}
 */
var twoSum = function(nums, target) {
    
};
```

# JavaScript Challenge 5. Power of Two
https://leetcode.com/problems/power-of-two/description/


Given an integer n, return true if it is a power of two. Otherwise, return false.

An integer n is a power of two, if there exists an integer x such that n == 2x.

 
Example 1:

Input: n = 1
Output: true
Explanation: 20 = 1
Example 2:

Input: n = 16
Output: true
Explanation: 24 = 16
Example 3:

Input: n = 3
Output: false
 

Constraints:

-231 <= n <= 231 - 1
 

Follow up: Could you solve it without loops/recursion?

``` JS
/**
 * @param {number} n
 * @return {boolean}
 */
var isPowerOfTwo = function(n) {
    
};
```



# JavaScript Challenge 6. Move Zeroes
https://leetcode.com/problems/move-zeroes/description/

Given an integer array nums, move all 0's to the end of it while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.

Note that you must do this in-place without making a copy of the array.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [0,1,0,3,12]
Output: [1,3,12,0,0]
Example 2:

Input: nums = [0]
Output: [0]
 

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 104
-231 <= nums[i] <= 231 - 1
 

Follow up: Could you minimize the total number of operations done?

```JS
/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @return {void} Do not return anything, modify nums in-place instead.
 */
var moveZeroes = function(nums) {
    
};
```

# JavaScript Challenge 7. Pascal's Triangle

https://leetcode.com/problems/pascals-triangle/description/


Given an integer numRows, return the first numRows of Pascal's triangle.

In Pascal's triangle, each number is the sum of the two numbers directly above it as shown:

![alt text](image.png)

Example 1:

Input: numRows = 5
Output: [[1],[1,1],[1,2,1],[1,3,3,1],[1,4,6,4,1]]
Example 2:

Input: numRows = 1
Output: [[1]]
 

Constraints:

1 <= numRows <= 30

```JS 
/**
 * @param {number} numRows
 * @return {number[][]}
 */
var generate = function(numRows) {
    
};
```

242. Valid Anagram
Easy
Topics
Companies
Given two strings s and t, return true if t is an anagram of s, and false otherwise.

An Anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "anagram", t = "nagaram"
Output: true
Example 2:

Input: s = "rat", t = "car"
Output: false
 

Constraints:

1 <= s.length, t.length <= 5 * 104
s and t consist of lowercase English letters.
 

Follow up: What if the inputs contain Unicode characters? How would you adapt your solution to such a case?

``` JS
/**
 * @param {string} s
 * @param {string} t
 * @return {boolean}
 */
var isAnagram = function(s, t) {
    
};
```


# JavaScript Challenge 9. Excel Sheet Column Title
Given an integer columnNumber, return its corresponding column title as it appears in an Excel sheet.

For example:

A -> 1
B -> 2
C -> 3
...
Z -> 26
AA -> 27
AB -> 28 
...
 

Example 1:

Input: columnNumber = 1
Output: "A"
Example 2:

Input: columnNumber = 28
Output: "AB"
Example 3:

Input: columnNumber = 701
Output: "ZY"
 

Constraints:

1 <= columnNumber <= 231 - 1

```JS
/**
 * @param {number} columnNumber
 * @return {string}
 */
var convertToTitle = function(columnNumber) {
    
};
```
