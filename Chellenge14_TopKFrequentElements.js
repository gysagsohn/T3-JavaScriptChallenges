/*
My initial thought is to use bubble sort and mapping to solve this problem. However, I do not believe that will meet the requirement of O(n log n). Bubble sort should be O(n^2)

After doing some research I believe QuickSelect would be the efficient method.

Based of that method I would need to do the following:
step 1 - frequency map
step 2 - create a unique element array
step 3 - partition function
step 4 - Quickselect function
step 5 - return result 

I am not sure how to code this. I will do more research and come back to it
